# Internationary 

Internationary is a one stop informational website for international students at the University of Washington to help ease their transition at the university without
getting confused. The website provides information and helpful resources for four central topics - Finance, Housing, Transportation, and Healthcare. 

## Purpose 

The UW is home to nearly 8,000 international students representing more than 100 countries.

There is a lot of information that international students need to be able to adjust to this new place. Coming from a totally different education system and an entirely 
different culture, an international student needs to feel confident about where he/she is going and how to have a successful life there, and even while at college, 
they should be able to access and know about resources which are available to them. Researching and collecting information is a cumbersome process and students might
miss some useful information or get the wrong information which might hurt them in the long run.

## Technologies Used 

HTML, CSS 

## Research 

To better identify the problem, we conducted user research through surveys and interviews with international students. Literature review was done to better understand the 
issues faced and market research was done to identify any existing solutions. 

We conducted a survey for international students where the central question we asked were - 
* Prior to attending university, what were your concerns about studying in the US?
* What additional information do you wish had been provided before your arrival in the US?
* Would a website that integrated information and resources for smoother transition into the US be helpful?

We conducted interviews with international students and their parents and these were the main questions that we asked - 
* How was your transition from the education system in your country to here?
* How long before coming here did you start preparing to adjust?
* What resources did you have/use to adapt before coming here?
* What resources did you have/use to adapt after coming here?
* Was there something you wish you knew more about/or knew earlier that would have helped you in your time in college? or What could have made your life easier here?

The feedback we received from our research was positive since we noticed that 95.5% of the students stated that this website would be helpful. Through the results of our
research, we decided to work on the four topics - finance, housing, transportation, and healthcare.

**Future Scope** 

A lot of research can be conducted on our project. Future teams can conduct research on indirect stakeholders such as the University's International Student Services Office and 
College Counsellors. Our research reported that issues such as job hunting and visa restrictions are also of concern to international students so deeper research can be conducted
Since we plan on expanding our website to other UW Campuses and in the future to other colleges with high number of international students, there is great scope for future research.

## Design 

The design of our website is clean, aesthetic, and clutter free. For our design process we created an intitial prototype of our website on Wix and using that as a 
template, we coded the design for our website. This made sure that our design was consistent through the website and pages. We have made the design of our website to be 
mobile friendly. Our website makes use of different pages covering each topic that we are addressing. The pages contain links to external resources. We have also made use of animations in certain pages to give our website a 
lively touch. Our website makes use of short blocks of text and relevant images to make sure it is easy for the user to navigate while also being engaging. The navigation 
bar leads to different pages for our topics.

**Future Scope** 

Although the design of our website is laid out, future work can be done to improve the design. We believe that there is a different way of designing everything so the
website can be redesigned if needed. Since the website can be expanded to UW Campuses and other colleges, there would be a need to re-design the website and layout of 
the pages in accordance to the new content. Further user testing when the website is expanded can help future designers redesign our website appropriately.

## Code 

We have coded our website using HTML and CSS. The code for our website is present in this repository and is public for people who wish to continue on our project. The 
repository contains five html files. The index.html file serves as the landing page of our project and links to other html files. The other four html files are for finance,
housing, transportation, and healthcare. These files contain links to external resources. The css folder contains style.css which has the code for the design of our website. 
All the images are present in the img folder of our repository. Our code is simple and intuitive to follow. 

**Future Scope** 

Future coders can help us expand our website to other UW campuses and colleges. Front-end developers would be needed to code new pages for our website. A user account can be
set up using backend coding. Sign in and Sign up can be added using firebase authentication. Our website can be coded further to accomodate more information and resources 
for other campuses.
